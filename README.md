# Spanish DBpedia Autoupdate Review

In 2020, an automatic update pipeline was developed to periodically load Spanish DBpedia data from dbpedia databus. 

The objective is to review the Spanish DBpedia autoupdate process originally implemented, identify current failure points, and fix it. The project also includes building a high-quality corpus (+1M articles) and a few services around this dataset.
